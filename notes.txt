From Wikipedia:
Players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

What will happen when a user clicks "Play"?:

represents the game starting opposed to the individuals turn. This will take the names of the two players and assign them a side on the page to display their turn score and total score. There will also be a hold button, and a roll button in the middle of the page to take their turn.
